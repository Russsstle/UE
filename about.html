                <p>A  CHED-Recognized Center of Development in IT Education
                The UE College of Computer Studies and Systems (CCSS) pioneered in the offering of a baccalaureate degree in Computer Science (BSCS) in the University Belt area starting SY 1988-1989.
                As early as 1984, the University started offering computer courses built into the curriculum of the BS in Business Administration program, both as credit-earning subjects as well as non-degree computer courses.
                In 1986, the CCSS was still known as the Computer Institute for Studies and Systems (CISS). Its initial 
                offerings up to 1987 were non-degree computer training programs conducted in consortium with the University of the Philippines.
                 Prof. Nati C. San Gabriel was the Director of the CISS and later the Dean when the Institute became a College.</p>
